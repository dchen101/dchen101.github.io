I can see how the stereo type threat is a real problem in society for minorities. When an overwhelming majority of the population has a negative perception of a minority, it can be hard to overcome such a barrier. If people have low expectations of a group, then that group probably feels that it is okay to fulfill that preconceived image, and just meet that low expectation. Every once in a while there will be a few people who want to break that image, and surpass those expectation. However, for people who are born into life with a rough background, it could be hard to acquire the motivation needed to break an image that has been ingrained in society. There are those that argue that it is an excuse, and that people can overcome any hardship, but at times if a person spends their whole life around a society with a negative image of a minority, that person might eventually start believing the stereotype.
