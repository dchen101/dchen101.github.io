<h2>Good Questions</h2>
<h4>6/7/2014</h4>

As I was reading up this assignment I was reminded of the old saying that "There are no stupid questions.". However, at times I do feel that there are silly questions at times, and people may ask these questions just to confirm what they already know. At DBC most of the questions I have asked were normally during the GPS sessions to help solidify the topic that was explored during the pairing session, and I recall most of them were answered, not directly, but in a manner that involves some thinking and research on our end. Personally I like to research and exhaust all options before asking. The only time I ask is when there is a time constraint and expediency is needed. After reading the articles provided, they all point that good questions involve being concise and clear. The person being asked should know what is being asked, and the question itself should be concise and to the point. If a problem is not being answered it could be that the question is unclear, or that the problem is not one that the community has an answer for yet.
