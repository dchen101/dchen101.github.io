There are many times in my life where I have over analyzed something and thought of a small action as something more than it is. Sometimes I take these small actions as a sign of disrespect, mainly because these actions are common courtesy and I feel they should be aboded by. Video games are a good example of instances where I over react to something that in the long run is insignificant. It is well known that in the online community people will encounter keyboard warriors. People who will say things that they would never ever say to people face to face in real life. The only thing that gives these people courage is the fact that they have a monitor to hide behind. The reason why this gets to me is because the guise of anonymity makes these people say things that they would never say face to face. One fay I came to realize that the people who would hide behind a keyboard and shoot there mouths off will not have any significant impact on what happens today, or tomorrow in my life.
