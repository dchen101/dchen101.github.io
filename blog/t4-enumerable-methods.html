          I think of Enumerable methods as efficient ways of coding and running through every partitions of an object. You can use enumerable to look through large arrays and hashes. They perform a similar function to that of loops. The .map enumerable rune the argument block provided on each element of, and retuning the value from the block. An example would be: [1,2,3].map {|n|n+n}. The object would be array [1,2,3], and the block or argument would be {|n|n+n}. This would return a result of [2,4,6]. AS you can see it grab each element of the array, are represented by |n|, and applies it to the argument block. This is a very efficient refactored way of looping through an entire array. Easy to follow, and easy to read.
