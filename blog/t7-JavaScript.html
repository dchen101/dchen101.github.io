There are many key differences as well as similarities between Ruby and Java script. However, one difference that sticks out to me is the use of hashed in Ruby and the use of objects in Java script. One thing that sticks out the most for me in Javascript is that there aren't as many enumerable and built in methods you can use to manipulate and find values. Java script seems to primarily rely on the for in statement when traversing though an object, making it somewhat confusing when you need to sift through properties and values nested within properties. Syntax is similar, both use the ":". The differences are numerous, and almost seems like an entirely different language.
