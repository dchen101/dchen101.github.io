       Pairing with others is a very good experience. Most of the pairing sessions that I have attended have been very helpful, there are times where my partner is able to make suggestions that I never consider, because my thought process is completely different from theirs. A good example of this would be refactoring. Ruby has so many predefined methods, that makes refactoring a difficult task, but if my partner knows a quick prebuilt method, then the code becomes so much cleaner. The group pairing sessions have been a big help since most of the guides know their material, and can provide guidance when we hit a road block. I would definitely say that pairing is a very helpful exercise.  However, it is hard to take away a lot from the feedback from the partners, a lot of it is very generic, and most of the time the task gets completed without any problems.
