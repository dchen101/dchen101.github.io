          Arrays and hashes are useful data structures for storing certain data types. When compared to other arrays in other languages, arrays in Ruby are very intuitive. One key difference is that there is no need to assign the data type to the array. When I took intro programming classes for C++ and Java, arrays were populated with a specific data type, such as integers and strings. In ruby, it seems that you could mix and populate the arrays with certain data types. Also the prebuilt methods make completing task so much easier. Methods such as sort and max enable ease of use when programming. Hashes are also an interesting and new data structure. Hashes are similar to arrays, but instead of using numbers as addresses, programmers can assign a key to the value, which has many uses when it comes to programming.
