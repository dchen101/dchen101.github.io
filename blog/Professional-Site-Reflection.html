I have cleaned up the site a bit, but there is so much more I would like to do before I consider the site complete. I am still unable to find a way to implement drop down menus in CSS style sheets, and I am hoping to find a way. I've seen some good examples, and I am hoping the Jekyll tools will help me push my site closer to being a finished product. As I start DBS I would like to have the projects laid out on the bottom, as well as clean up the styling to make it look more professional. By the time DBC is over I will hopefully have a complete product.
