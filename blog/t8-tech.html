<h2>Test Driven</h2>

Test driven programming, does have it's advantages, but it seems very strange to first create a test and then base the code on the results expected from the test. Since high school, my code has always been driven by achieving a result. Like many others, I am used to being given a prompt and then, writing code based on the prompt. Basing the code on the prompt I feel personally allows for more creativity, but if a program were to be test driven, I can see how it can limit a lot of problems, as well as force programmers to create code that will accommodate what the client or manager wants.
