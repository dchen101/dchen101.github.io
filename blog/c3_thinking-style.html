          I lost the results of my thinking style test, but judging from everything that I have done so far, and all the past events that I have to refer to in my life, I would think that I am a concrete random person. I favor a hands on experimental approach. I enjoy taking risks and going with my gut feelings. I do like to solve problems independently, and at my own pace in my own way. I tend to go against following routines, but I think I would benefit more from having a more structured approach, because at time things can get messy. With the monumental task of mastering coding in such a condensed amount of time, I feel that having a plan of attack would be the most logical way to approach such an intimidating curriculum. However, these habits will be hard to form due to my past years of learning habits. Being more open minded and perceptive to new methods will help me retain the material better. I do have a growth mindset as opposed to a fixed one, so having an open mind is not a problem, but getting a habit to stick is not an easy task. Hopefully throughout this prep phase I can condition myself to pick up several good learning habits. Only time will tell.
