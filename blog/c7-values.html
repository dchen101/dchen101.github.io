<h2>Exploring Your Values</h2>
<h4>5/31/2014</h4>
<section>
Accomplishment, ambition, Will-power, and close relationships come to mind whenI am at my emotional height. I do strive for these values when the opportunity is present to fulfill them, so I would rate myself around a 4 on a scale of 1 to 5 in living up to these values. Close relationships are important to me because the a persons company really does have a large impact on their outlook in life. Those relationships formed with people can take you to new heights, or bring you down to new lows. There is no denying that the people you meet in life will play a role in defining who you are. These values can help overcome stereotype threats because they tend to gravitate and elevate towards striving toward a goal.
