  These past couple years a lot of my programming has been more toward object oriented programming. Defining classes and methods. A lot of the programming we have done recently revolves around structuring data into classes, where the methods can be accessed and eve manipulated. It is a very nicely structured and neat way to approach solve problems. Things can be taken apart, changed and modified without too much trouble. Functional programming appears to be more structured, and I believe that when I first started out programming I was more of a functional programmer. I was given variables and with those variables I used function to achieve the desired outcome. That is an oversimplification of what functional programming is, but that is as much experience as I feel that I have with it. A lot of commercial software is more revolved around object oriented programming, so my current exposure to this type of programming should not come as a big surprise.
