  Classes are an integral part of object oriented programming and allow for a structured and organized code. Within these classes people can use many different types of variables in these classes. The one I most commonly encounter is the instance variable, which usually begins with the @ symbol. Instance variables, as the name suggests, allows for that variable to be accessed in that instance of a class. These variables can be a passed from method to method within the class, making it easy to pass on data, as well as getting the answer to the problem you want to solve. For example say you want to solve a problem that required multiple functions that depend on each other, but you do not want to enter in a new argument every time you call upon the method within the function. Instance variables are your answers. Rather then programming methods that take in arguments, you can just have the method use the instance variable.
