Javascript Objects:

Javascript objects are composed of properties.

var voteCount = {
  president: {},
  vicePresident: {},
  secretary: {},
  treasurer: {}
}

The properties can also be called objects with properties which can also be called upon as well.

      for (var position in voteCount) {
        var max = 0;
        var answer ='';
        console.log(position)
        for (var candidate in voteCount[position]){
        console.log(candidate);
          if(max<voteCount[position][candidate]){
            console.log(voteCount[position][candidate]);
           max= voteCount[position][candidate]
           answer = candidate;
          }
        }
         officers[position]=answer; 

This is an example of nested objects. When needing to call upone certain properties, it is important to understand dot notation, as well as btacket notation and when to use which. Bracket notation can be viewed very similarly to accessing a multi dimensional array. Given the coordinates, you can extract the properties that you are looking for.
