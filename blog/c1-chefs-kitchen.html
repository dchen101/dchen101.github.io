I know most of these programs are extremely intense, due to teaching and consuming the amount of material given
in such a short amount of time. That being said it is one of the reasons why I wanted to sign on. In the past
I have taken programming courses, but I never really retained the material in its entirety. I have found that
for me personally, when I am learning I tend to retain what I learn best through being hands on and doing as opposed
to just reading and listening. I feel like this type of culture might be more suited for someone with a learning style like
me, but again I still do not know what to expect, so I say that with caution. I know just by being accepted does not mean
any guarantees, and that it is just the start of my journey. I do not expect the restaurant experience, I do not expect to just
pay my money and get a product. I go into this program with an open mind.
