          There are many issues in the tech industry, too many to list here, but one that perhaps hits close to me personally is the shortage of programmers with skill sets needed to help aid in Web 2.0â€™s exponential growth. As society keep moving towards higher connectivity through the web, the number of people with the skillsets needed to maintain, grow, and evolve the web are small in comparison to the demand.  Demand for software engineers is growing by leaps and bounds, and the only answer is to provide more software engineers, however the rate at which they are being taught and developed pales in comparison to what is needed. One solution is to create specialized efficient programs that help develop the skill sets needed to supplant the demand. Similar to trade schools, which create mechanics in a short amount of time. Coding schools can help equip people with the tools needed to be a software engineer. The only way to meet high demand is by producing a steady supply. By graduating quality software developers at a high rate, the gap between supply and demand will subside.
